I started playing with computers when I was 6 years old before Windows 3.1 came into existance and enjoyed building programs in BASIC and using the DOS prompt to play Pango.

Since then I have written screenplays, short stories, run audio on film sets, sung and played guitar in front of audiences, traded the stock market, helped admistrate a small non-profit, been a public speaker, helped build houses, and though it all sought to also develop people.

I guess i've come full circle and am becoming a Web Developer to create applications that will make the world a better place.

I'm orginally from Florida, but have also lived in Virgina, and now currently reside in NYC.

I enjoy great coffee made perfectly, fantasy football, and spending time with my wife and son.

I also eat cereal out of salad bowls!
