*"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."*
**--Nelson Mandela**

I started playing with computers before Windows 3.1 came into existence. I enjoyed building programs in BASIC and using the DOS prompt to play Pango.

Since then I have written screenplays and short stories, run audio on film sets, sung and played guitar in front of audiences, traded the stock market, helped admistrate a small non-profit, been a public speaker, helped build houses... 

...and though it all sought to also to grow as a person by learning about others, the world, and myself.

I guess i've come full circle now, and I am becoming a Web Developer to create applications that will make the world a better place by being a part of the transformation of the education sector. 

I'm orginally from Florida, but have also lived in Virgina, and now currently reside in NYC.

I enjoy great coffee made perfectly, fantasy football, and spending time with my wife and son.

I also have two toes that are almost fully webbed together!
